### **My Projects Page**

* **Hero Section**
    * **Title:** My Projects
    * **Subtitle:** Partnering to create equitable change through strategic planning, community engagement, leadership development, and innovation.
* **Projects Section**
    * **Section Title:** Featured Initiatives
    * **Project 1: Democratizing AI**
        * **Category:** AI Equity & Innovation
        * **Quote:** "Technology should empower everyone, not just widen existing divides. Let's ensure AI serves accessible, sustainable innovation for all."
        * **Content:**
            Inspired by insights from the Targeted Universalism Learning Cohort, this initiative tackles the growing gap between rapid AI advancements and their accessibility for small businesses and underrepresented entrepreneurs facing systemic barriers. We're building pathways—through tools, training, and expertise—for these businesses to harness AI's potential, innovate sustainably, and chart their own course, whether nurturing a local enterprise or scaling for broader impact. My vision is to democratize AI, making it a tool for equity, not further disparity.
        * **Focus Areas:** Small Businesses, Entrepreneurs, Underrepresented Communities, AI Accessibility, Sustainable Innovation.
    * **Project 2: The Community Network Proposal (CNP)**
        * **Category:** Community Network Building & Systemic Change
        * **Quote:** "True transformation happens when communities lead. The CNP centers Afro-Indigenous voices to build collective power and dismantle inequities."
        * **Content:**
            Fueled by my journey and the urgent need to address systemic injustice, the CNP is a transformative initiative centering Afro-Indigenous communities in Washington State. In a landscape often resistant to explicitly anti-racist agendas, the CNP champions community-driven solutions, addressing interconnected challenges like health disparities, economic inequality, and environmental justice. Using targeted universalism, we aim to ensure Afro-Indigeneity no longer predicts life outcomes. Key strategies include strengthening social capital, amplifying narratives, grassroots research, community-led initiatives, place-based advocacy, and increasing Black representation in policy (e.g., WA PEAR Plan). This is about mobilizing collective action for equitable, sustainable futures.
        * **Focus Areas:** Afro-Indigenous Communities, Washington State Policy, Collective Action, Health Equity, Economic Justice, Environmental Justice, PEAR Plan.
    * **Project 3: Equity-Focused Strategic Planning**
        * **Category:** Organizational Transformation & DEI Strategy
        * **Quote:** "Strategy without equity just reorganizes the status quo. True transformation requires embedding equity at the core."
        * **Content:**
            Effective strategy must be rooted in equity; otherwise, we merely reinforce existing power dynamics. I partner with diverse organizations to move beyond surface-level DEI. This involves delivering comprehensive training, co-creating actionable strategic plans and DEI roadmaps, and facilitating capacity-building sessions. Guiding organizations like the Puget Sound Partnership, King Conservation District, and various WA State Agencies, we engage in courageous conversations about bias, harm accountability, and inclusion, influencing policy and practice from the leadership level down to create lasting systemic change.
        * **Partners Include:** Puget Sound Partnership, Clackamas County Agencies, King Conservation District, WA State Dept. of Social and Health Services, Dept. of Children, Youth, and Families, Office of Independent Investigations, Port of Tacoma.
    * **Project 4: Leadership Coaching & Organizational Development**
        * **Category:** Leadership Development & Cultural Humility
        * **Quote:** "Leadership begins with self-awareness and the courage to challenge assumptions. I create brave spaces for that growth."
        * **Content:**
            My coaching philosophy centers on fostering brave spaces where leaders can examine beliefs, expand perspectives, and align actions with values—especially around equity and inclusion. I provide executive coaching (leveraging tools like the IDI), team building, and board development support to strengthen organizational culture, enhance intercultural competence, and foster alignment. Witnessing the ripple effect of individual and team transformation within organizations like the WA State Housing Finance Commission, City of Olympia, SafePlace, university programs, and Roosevelt Alumni for Racial Equity is the most rewarding part of this work.
        * **Partners Include:** WA State Housing Finance Commission, City of Olympia, SafePlace, University of Oregon, University of California, University of Washington Programs, Roosevelt Alumni for Racial Equity.
    * **Project 5: Community Engagement & Accessibility Planning**
        * **Category:** Inclusive Community Engagement & Relationship Building
        * **Quote:** "Authentic engagement meets communities where they are, honoring their voices and addressing barriers to participation."
        * **Content:**
            Shaped by experiences of exclusion, my approach prioritizes authentic relationship-building and dismantling barriers (language, culture, geography, distrust). I've led statewide initiatives for WA Dept. of Health, Dept. of Agriculture, and Washington's Lottery, designing inclusive outreach strategies and multiple pathways for meaningful involvement. Innovative methods, like multilingual, cross-generational "design labs" for Sno-Isle Libraries exploring "connectedness," ensure recommendations truly reflect community needs and aspirations, leading to more equitable outcomes.
        * **Partners Include:** WA State Dept. of Health, WA State Dept. of Agriculture, Washington's Lottery, Birth to 25 Greenlake Pierce County, Sno-Isle Libraries, Northwest Straits Initiative.
    * **Project 6: Research, Reporting & Equity Analysis**
        * **Category:** Research & Data-Driven Strategy
        * **Quote:** "Data must illuminate lived experiences. My research centers community voices while maintaining analytical rigor to drive equitable action."
        * **Content:**
            My background in policy and research, combined with lived experience, drives my commitment to methodologies that center marginalized voices. I conduct comprehensive equity landscape analyses, needs assessments, and develop DEI implementation strategies for partners like King County Housing Authority and WA State Dept. of Commerce. The goal is always to translate complex findings into clear, practical frameworks that guide leadership, foster accountability, and lead to tangible change informed by the communities most impacted.
        * **Partners Include:** King County Housing Authority, WA State Dept. of Commerce, WA State Dept. of Health, and others listed in Strategic Planning & OD.
