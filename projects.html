                <img src="img/AI Lesson.png" alt="AI Lesson illustration" class="project-image float-left">
                <p>Inspired by insights gained from the Targeted Universalism Learning Cohort, Tevin's newest project aims to democratize AI to empower every small business and entrepreneur. Current industry data and expert analysis reveal a growing gap, with rapid AI advancements outpacing the accessibility for many small businesses and underrepresented entrepreneurs already facing systemic barriers. This initiative seeks to bridge that divide by providing accessible, cutting-edge AI tools and expertise, enabling businesses to innovate sustainably and chart their own path—whether nurturing a beloved local enterprise or scaling toward Fortune 100-level impact.</p>

            <h2>The Community Network Proposal</h2>
            <img src="img/Community Members sitting around a table.jpg" alt="Community members collaborating" class="project-image float-right">
            <p>The Community Network Proposal (CNP) is a transformative initiative dedicated to centering Afro-Indigenous communities in Washington State through collective action, collaboration, and strategic partnerships. In response to ongoing systemic inequities and an evolving sociopolitical landscape resistant to explicitly anti-racist agendas, the CNP advocates for community-driven solutions and empowerment that explicitly center Black experiences while benefiting society at large.</p>
            <p>Recognizing the interconnectedness of community well-being, the initiative addresses critical issues such as health disparities, economic inequality, environmental justice, and systemic barriers faced disproportionately by Black communities. Through targeted universalism, the project seeks to dismantle structural inequities, ensuring that Afro-Indigeneity and proximity to Blackness no longer predict health, economic, or social outcomes.</p>
            <p>Key elements of the Community Network Proposal include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strengthening social capital and building strategic partnerships.</li>
                <li>Amplifying narratives, information-sharing, and collective storytelling.</li>
                <li>Conducting grassroots research and developing actionable community metrics.</li>
                <li>Establishing community-led initiatives and communication platforms.</li>
                <li>Prioritizing place-based issues like housing equity, tax fairness, public health, and education.</li>
                <li>Increasing Black representation in policy and decision-making through initiatives like Washington State’s Pro-Equity Anti-Racism (PEAR) Plan.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By creating a robust network rooted in community knowledge and strategic collaboration, this initiative will mobilize collective action, amplify voices historically silenced, and foster systemic transformation for equitable and sustainable community outcomes.</p>
